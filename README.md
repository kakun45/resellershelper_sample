# Classy Graphs's sample code
My repo for the entire project is private I'm adding these files here for a demo purpose only. This is NOT a complete code.

`Classy Graphs` is a comprehensive Python-based tool designed to streamline and optimize various metrics for resellers in the e-commerce domain. This project primarily targets resellers who deal with multiple marketplaces and need a unified platform to manage their KPIs, track sales, and analyze their performance. I started it in 2020 when Poshmark had no dashboard for sellers, just the .CSV sales report. As a seller, I knew exactly what I needed, and I decided to make it. The dashboard exists in the app as of today, but the metrics are limited.

Here is a sample run of the application https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ouAag71SeoWP2P_t0qaxfUevsI5LKmmc?usp=sharing

Users: Poshmark sellers, which are ~50% of 80 mln users, with the potential to expand to Etsy, Merkari, etc. sellers. 

Are you a Poshmark seller, know how to code in Python and build React, and would like to contribute to open source? Please [reach out](mailto:xeniya.shoiko@outlook.com). 

## Key Features:

# Multi-Marketplace Integration: 
`Classy Graph` offers seamless integration with popular e-commerce platforms like eBay, Poshmark, and Mercari (the sample included is for Poshmark). This enables users to manage their metrics in sales and stocks across multiple platforms from a centralized dashboard.

# Sales Analytics and Reporting: 
`Classy Graphs` provides in-depth analytics on sales performance, from a pro seller's point of view, allowing users to track their revenue, identify best-selling products, and assess the effectiveness of their pricing strategies.
